## Description
<p>The Envato Theme Check is a modified fork of the original Theme Check by Otto42 with additional Envato specific WordPress checks.</p>
<p>It is an easy way to test your theme and make sure it's up-to-date with the latest Envato review standards. With it, you can run all the same automated testing tools on your theme that Envato Reviewers use for WordPress theme submissions.</p>

<p>The tests are run through a simple admin menu and all results are displayed at once. This is very handy for theme developers, or anybody looking to make sure that their theme supports the latest WordPress theme standards and practices.</p>

## Frequently Asked Questions
